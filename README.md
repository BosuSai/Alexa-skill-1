# Alexa-skill-1
 Animal sounds gaming and quiz Alexa skill.
I created this gaming skill because Games, Trivia, & Accessories skills are top rated and attracted more users, which is the driving force to build this skill. This Alexa skills plays the sound of the various animals, the user of skill should guess the animal, the Alexa provides the response whether the user is correct or wrong and user can also take quiz in which an animal's 
sound is played, and an interesting fact is provided to the user the user should guess whether this fact is relevant to the sound of the animal played.  
At the end of the Quiz the Alexa skill provide the score and there is negative marking. I feel that this game will be interesting and will attract more users.
